        <p><b><i>AZAH!</i></b> "AZAH" (Ameen, Z, Ayaan, Hassan) is an abbreviation my brother, a couple of outside school friends, and I call ourselves. We've known each other essentially our whole lives, and here's a picture from one of our adventures this summer. (we always take the T) </p>

        <p><b><i>More AZAH! (plus some others) </i></b> Here's another AZAH adventure that we did earlier in the summer. The scenery in downtown Boston was beautiful, and we went with some of Ayaan's high-school friends (They're all in college now).</p>
