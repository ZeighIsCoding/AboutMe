        <p>As a pianist, singer, and beatboxer, music holds a large and special place in my daily life. While I was raised on 70s, 80s, and 90s pop and classic rock, my music taste has now become diverse and expansive (read: emo, punk, and electronic). Although when it comes to playing music, I am mostly a jazz pianist and I play mostly songs composed by Norah Jones as well as Antonio Carlos Jobim. Music also is my primary method through which I both rant and connect with people over. </p>
